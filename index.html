   <p>
      Welcome to my page dedicated to CokaCola's No Sugar, Zero and Zero Sugar products.
      Healthier then 75% of vegetables and 92% fruit (from what I've read online).
      Also included are photos, un-related information and terribly but hopfully improving web pages made in static site
      generator <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jeckyll</a>. 
      
   <p>
      Fact #8: Coke Zero has less more nutrients then compensating brands.
      FACT #4: Coze Zero can be used as a substitute for baby formula according to leading nutritionists.
