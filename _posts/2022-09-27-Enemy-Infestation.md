**Installation**
* https://www.myabandonware.com/game/enemy-infestation-a2o
* Install RIP Version
* Install "10 minutes fix for members dieing + few patches"

**Windowed Mode**
* Use dxwnd
* https://sourceforge.net/projects/dxwnd/
* On the Mouse tab select:
  * Correct mouse position
  * Position message processing

**Multiplayer**
* Online multiplayer should work fine through the TCP/IP option.
* Port forward TCP + UDP Ports 2300-2400,47624 

**Review & Thoughts**
* Takes a long time to get working correctly.
* Font is difficult to read and can't be resized.
* Graphics look good with the occasional graphical glitch.
* No crashes.
* Tutorial is helpful but slow paced and not exciting.
* No running in the game makes it feel slow.
