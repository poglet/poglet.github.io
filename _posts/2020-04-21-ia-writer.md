Here I am writing this message in an app name iA Writer.  This message can be saved to my Google drive or Dropbox account.  Once saved, I can use the web browser on my phone to open my GitHub repository and upload the file to the posts folder.  GitHub and Jekyll will work together to post this message onto the internet.
