Finally had a free day and descided to finish Deus Ex.  Played as a non-leathal character who would occasionly get angry and shoot people (just the bad ones).  Some things I did while in-game:

[![Deus Ex](/blogpics/DeusEx.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex_(video_game))

* Kept Paul alive
* Kept Walton Simons alive
  * This was done by avoiding him at the both the under water base and Area 51.
* Killed agent Navarre with a LAM
* Ended all commuinication and set the world into a new dark age.

I completed the game using the [GMDX v10](https://www.moddb.com/mods/gmdx-v10-community-update) mod that provided many enhancements.  I would like to replay the game without any mods now to do a comparison.
