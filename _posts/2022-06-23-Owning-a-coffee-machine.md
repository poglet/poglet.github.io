# Reasons I Like Owning a Coffee Machine

For the last few months I've been using a Breville Infuser coffee machine paired with the Breville Smart Grinder Pro coffee grinder.  Here are some of the reaosns I prefer making coffee at home compared to buying a coffee at the cafe.

## Benefits

* The convienence of being able to have an espresso when at home.
* Tailoring the coffee to my preferences.
* Trying different styles of coffee beans.
* Learning about the coffee making process.
* Finding the perfect coffee cup.
* Experimenting with different accessories.
* Experimenting with different types of milk.
* Being able to learn latte milk art.
