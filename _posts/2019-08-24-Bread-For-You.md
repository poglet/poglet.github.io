I’ve been living around the corner from a little cafe named.  It’s a Korean bakery shop selling small breads, cakes, pastries.  I enjoy going there for a coffee on Saturday mornings.

The shop is small with only a few tables and chairs and I only ever see a single staff member.  The best thing about this place is the coffee is excellent.  It’s great to set there while reading the news or trying to learn a language.  It is rare that anybody else will come and I’ve never seen the shop full at this time.

The address is 6 Zamia St, Sunnybank and it seems to be open all the time.
