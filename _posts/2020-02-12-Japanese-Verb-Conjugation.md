In a little over one month I’ll arrive in Tokyo. I’ll be travelling with 3 others and I plan to stay in the Tokyo area. November should be a great time to see the autumn leaves, there might be some nice spots to take photos too.
I’ve been studying Japanese for a few weeks now and am trying to improve a little every day. Unfortunately when I learn something new I forget old.
