1. Download and install https://zandronum.com.
2. Copy relevant doom .wad files to the Zandronum directory.
3. Launch zandronum.exe from the command line with the relevant parameters.

```sh
C:\Zandronum\zandronum.exe -iwad doom.wad -host +cooperative 1
```
![Zandronum Server](/blogpics/Zandronum Server.jpg)

4. Zandronum will create a .ini in the directory with the game settings that you can adjust manually if required.  Other settings can be created from the server window.
