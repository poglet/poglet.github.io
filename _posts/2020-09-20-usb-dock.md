If you are having issues running multiple monitors or 4K monitors on the *HP USB-C Dock G5* you can enable an option on the PC to fix these issues.

1.	Boot into the BIOS of the connected HP Laptop
2.	Select **Advanced**
3.	Enable ‘**Enable High Resolution mode when connected to a USB-C DP alt mode dock**’ checkbox.
